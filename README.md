# Optimal Control Files
In this repo, I just upload some codes related to the Optimal Control course at LiU. The shared files are not 100% verified but they can give you an initial idea.

The source of this course is "Optimization for Learning and Control,
Anders Hansson and Martin Andersen". That's a great book.

## File descriptions
