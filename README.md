# Optimal Control Files
In this repo, I just upload some codes related to the Optimal Control course at LiU. The shared files are not 100% verified but they can give you an initial idea.

The source of this course ([Optimal Contrl TSRT08](https://isy.gitlab-pages.liu.se/rt/en/courses/TSRT08/)) is "Optimization for Learning and Control, Anders Hansson and Martin Andersen". That's a great book.
